# Day5
Exploratory Data Analysis

# Overview
This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset to extract meaningful insights using Python libraries such as Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib.
The analysis focuses on understanding survival patterns based on various passenger features.

# Task Structure
train.csv — Titanic dataset file
edavs.py — Python script containing full EDA code
OUTPUTS — file containing screenshots of all the outputs

# Requirements
Python 3.7 or higher
pandas
matplotlib
seaborn

# Key Features
1.Summary statistics and dataset overview
2.Visualization of missing values
3.Histograms for Age distribution
4.Count plots for survival analysis
5.Boxplots comparing Age and Passenger Class
6.Scatterplots showing Fare vs Age
7.Correlation heatmap of numeric features
8.Pairplots colored by survival status
